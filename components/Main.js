            <p className="main-pgtext"> Born in New Jersey, raised in North Carolina. I always enjoyed STEM, but didn't even know Georgia Tech was a school until a few days before the deadline application. I, now, have found myself loving life in Atlanta, Georgia at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology. Go Yackets! </p>
            <h3> Interests </h3> 
            <p className="main-pgtext"> Being a visionary at heart, I'd love to start anything with anyone.
            I like to run, I tell myself I'll read more, and I am interested in Asian culture. </p>
